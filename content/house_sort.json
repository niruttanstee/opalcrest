You hear an overbearing voice saying, \"Those uniforms look a bit dull. Best if we get you all sorted in a house-ay?\". Many curious whispers muttered around you.\n\nAs you shuffle to the front, you see a wrinkled man with long ashen hair holding a blued glowing book. Once it's your turn, he smiles and asks you to **hold onto the book.**\n\n> *Press the button \"Hold onto the book\"*",

Your answer must be a truthful reflection of yourself. Are you ready?.\" the celestial being said calmly and asked.\n\n> Press the button below to respond"
